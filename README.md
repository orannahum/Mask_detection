Mask_detection
Corona mask project using OpenCV, SSD & MobileNetV2:

![](https://github.com/orannahum/Mask_detection/blob/master/corona%20mask%20detector.gif?raw=true)

The training and testing of the model is done with the help of the ipynb file. 
Part of the model's data was taken from data on the Kagle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection 
The without_mask folder contains 3063 images and the with_mask folder contains 1260 images. The facial recognition model is a built-in SSD model. 
The model trained on mask recognition is MobileNetV2. Condensation was performed for the data by augmentations. The test was done on an OpenCV object. 
There is a test on a video file and there is a test on live from a webcam.
